## Performance Optimization

### droidcon SF 2017 - Android Internals for Developers
- **Channel:** droidcon SF
- **Description:** What actually happens when my code calls Android APIs? We all know about onCreate, but who actually calls my method? In this talk, we're going to go behind the curtain and look at AOSP itself. We're going to dig into the internals of how Android OS manages the apps that we write and see: - How Intents work and how they get resolved - How our app works together with other Intents, Activities, Services, and Content Providers in features such as sharing - How the app lifecycle is being managed by the system - How these features are built on top of the built-in Linux primitives such as processes and Linux user accounts.
